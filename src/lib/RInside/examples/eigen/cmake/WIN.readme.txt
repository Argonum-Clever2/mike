
Building these examples on Windows is a bit more difficult than on Linux.

* Put R in the path:
C:\R\R-2.1X.X\bin
C:\R\R-2.1X.X\bin\i386

* Add required environment variables:
R_HOME	C:\R\R-2.1X.X
CYGWIN	nodosfilewarning

* Then libpack and libblas for Windows needed to be obtained from:

http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/index.html#libraries_mingw

* The CMakeLists.txt files expect the liblapack.lib and libblas.lib files to be in the same directory as themselves for the Windows build. You can edit lines 7 and 8 of the the CMakeLists.txt files if they are not in this location.

* I generally build in a 'build' directly below cmake:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../.
make

To run these example there are further DLL dependencies required not installed by RTools:

libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libgfortran.dll
libquadmath-0.dll
liblapack.dll

I was able to grab these by installing MinGW from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/gcc/Version4/
Use the version that matches the gcc version that is installed by RTools.

Once installed, either add their location to the PATH, or copy them to either the same directory as the example executable, or put them in the windows/system32 folder.
